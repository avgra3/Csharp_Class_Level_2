Q5 Response: The app takes in strings fronm the user. The values taken in are then converted to integers. If the values cannot be converted to integers, then a format execption is thrown. If the values are valid, then the app attempts to divide the numerator by the denominator. Errors will be raised if other mathematical errors occur. The result will be in integer division, so if there is a remainder value, it will be missing from the output.
